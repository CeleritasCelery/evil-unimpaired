# evil-unimpaired

This repository contains a port of Tim Pope's [unimpaired.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired). This repository exists because the code was originally available only in spacemacs and as a normal emacs evil user I wanted access to it. You can find the original source [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/layers/%2Bspacemacs/spacemacs-evil/local/evil-unimpaired/evil-unimpaired.el), which I will keep this repository up to date with.
